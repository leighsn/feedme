### Feedme
Very nice overall!
+ Suggest making your adapter a class with methods so it's clear where those methods live when they are called elsewhere in the app.
+ Overall, a little confusing to trace the flow of the application from file to file
+ Move the store out of the adapter
+ Your Readme is confusing. :p
